    Parameters
    ----------
    umbrella_trajs : list of K arrays, each of shape (T_i, d)
        List of arrays, each having T_i rows, one for each time step, and d columns where d is the dimension in which
        umbrella sampling was applied. Often d=1, and thus umbrella_trajs will be a list of 1d-arrays.
    centers : array-like of size K
        list or array of K center positions. Each position must be a d-dimensional vector. For 1d umbrella sampling,
        one can simply pass a list of centers, e.g. [-5.0, -4.0, -3.0, ... ]
    k : int or array-like of int
        the force constant used in the umbrellas, unit-less (e.g. kT per length unit). If different force constants
        were used for different umbrellas, a list or array of K force constants can be given.
        For multidimensional umbrella sampling, the force matrix must be used.
    mdtrajs : list of K arrays, each of shape (T_i, d), optional, default = None
        unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. Format like umbrella_trajs.

    Estimates a multi-thermodynamic Markov state model (MT-MSM) including an optimal estimate of the thermodynamics
    and kinetics at multiple thermodynamic states. The input are simulation data from multiple thermodynamic states,
    e.g. direct molecular dynamics at different temperatures, umbrella sampling, parallel tempering, metadynamics,
    or any mixture of them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtrajs : ndarray(T) of int, or list of ndarray(T_i) of int
        A single discrete trajectory or a list of discrete trajectories. The integers are indexes in 1,...,n
        enumerating the n Markov states or the bins the trajectory is in at any time.
    ttrajs : ndarray(T) of int, or list of ndarray(T_i) of int
        A single discrete trajectory or a list of discrete trajectories. The integers are indexes in 1,...,K
        enumerating the thermodynamic states the trajectory is in at any time.
    btrajs : ndarray(T,K) of float, or list of ndarray(T_i,K) of float
        A single trajectory or a list of trajectories of bias energies. Each frame has K bias energies, evaluating
        the energy of the current configuration in each of the K thermodynamic states.
    ground_state : int, optional, default=0
        index of the thermodynamic ground or reference state. The statistics of
        all thermodynamic states will be computed, but the state probabilities
        of this state will be set to the default state probabilities in the
        TRAM object that is returned
    maxiter : int, optional, default=100000
        The maximum number of TRAM iterations before the estimator exits unsuccessfully
    ftol : float, optional, default=1e-5
        Convergence criterion based on the max change in an self-consistent-iteration step

    Returns
    -------
    mtmsm : MultiThermMSM
        A multi-thermodynamic Markov state model which consists of stationary and kinetic quantities at all
        temperatures.

    Example
    -------
    **Example 1: Umbrella sampling**. Suppose we simulate in K umbrellas, centered at positions :math:`y_1,...,y_K`
    with bias energies

    .. math::
        b_k(x) = c (x - y_k)^2

    Suppose we have one simulation of length T in each umbrella, and they are ordered from 1 to K. We have discretized
    the x-coordinate into 100 bins.

    Then dtrajs, ttrajs and btrajs should each be a list of :math:`K` arrays.
    dtrajs would look for example like this:

    [ (1, 2, 2, 3, 2, ...),  (2, 4, 5, 4, 4, ...), ... ]

    where each array has length T, and is the sequence of bins (in the range 0 to 99) visited along the trajectory.
    ttrajs would look like this:

    [ (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...),  (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...), ... ]

    Because trajectory 1 stays in umbrella 1 (index 0), trajectory 2 stays in umbrella 2 (index 1), and so forth.
    btrajs is a list of K arrays, each having size T x K, e.g.:

    [[b_0(x0), b_1(x0), ..., b_K(x0)],
     [b_0(x1), b_1(x1), ..., b_K(x1)],
     ...
     [b_0(xT), b_1(xT), ..., b_K(xT)]]

    where xt is the x-coordinate in trajectory frame t, and the energy computed by the bias equation above.

    **Example 2: Parallel tempering**. Suppose we simulate at K temperatures and consider a switching between
    temperatures at time intervals corresponding to two saved time steps. We can choose to arrange trajectories
    either by replica or by temperature. If we give them by replica, the dtrajs might look like this:

    [ (1, 2, 9, 8, 1, ...),  (7, 8, 2, 2, 7, ...), ... ]

    and the ttrajs would look like:

    [ (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...),  (1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ...), ... ]

    So you see that at time step 3 and 5 we have exchanged replicas at the lowest and second-lowest temperatures.
    If the total length of our simulation is T time steps, btrajs will be a list of K arrays of size T x K. The
    first btraj would look like:

    [[b_0,0(x0), b_0,1(x0), ..., b_0,K(x0)],
     [b_0,0(x1), b_0,1(x1), ..., b_0,K(x1)],
     [b_1,0(x1), b_1,1(x1), ..., b_1,K(x1)],
     [b_1,0(x1), b_1,1(x1), ..., b_1,K(x1)],
     [b_0,0(x1), b_0,1(x1), ..., b_0,K(x1)],
     ...
    ]

    where

    .. math::
        b_i,j(x) = \frac{U(x)}{k_B} \left( \frac{1}{T_j} - \frac{1}{T_i} \right)

    is the bias energy involved in reweighting configuration x from the generating temperature :math:`T_i` to another
    temperature :math:`T_j`
